# Factory Method Pattern

GoF Definition: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This lets a class defer instatiation to subclasses.

When to use: Client doesn't know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtime, but just wants to get a class that will do the job.
