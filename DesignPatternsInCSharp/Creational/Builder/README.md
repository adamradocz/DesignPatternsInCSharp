# Builder Pattern

![Builder UML Diagram](Builder.svg)

GoF Definition: The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions.
The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.

## Elements of the Builder Pattern
- Director: The director-class controls the algorithm that generates the final product object.
- Builder: This interface defines all of the steps that must be taken in order to correctly create a product. The actual functionality of the builder is carried out in the concrete implementations.
- ConcreteBuilder: There may be any number of concrete builder classes inheriting from Builder. These classes contain the functionality to create a particular complex product.
- Product: The product class defines the type of the complex object that is to be generated by the builder pattern.
