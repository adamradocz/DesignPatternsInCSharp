# State Pattern

GoF Definition: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

Simple explanation: Allows an object to change what it does based on its current state.

## Elements of the State Pattern

- Context: Maintains an instance of a concrete state as the current state.
- Abstract State: Defines an interface which encapsulates all state-specific behaviours
- Concrate State: Implements behaviours specific to a particular state of context.

## Approch

- List of possible states.
- The conditions for transitioning between those states.
- The state its in when initialized, or its initial state.
