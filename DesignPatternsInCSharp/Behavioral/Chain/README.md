# Chain of responsibility Pattern

![Chain of responsibility UML Diagram](ChainOfResponsibility.svg)

Definition: Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Participants

- Handler: Handles the request, or delegates it to another handler, to which it keeps the reference in itself
